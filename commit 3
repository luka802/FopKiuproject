extractFunctions() processes the input text line by line , method finds functions with func and braces .
each time an opening brace { is encountered  counter is incremented and when a closing brace } is found, 
the counter is decremented when it reaches 0 it means function ends then it stores as string lasly it gives 2 things count of functions,
it found and functions i thinck this way it works perfectly fine even with nested functions.
