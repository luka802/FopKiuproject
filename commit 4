The first problem was handling expressions like a = a * b correctly. It was simply not working.
Later we realized that we could solve it with calculatinf right side first then giving that value to the left side

We then ran into trouble with nested functions like if statements inside while loops.
The braces would get messy. We fixed this by evaluating the if condition first and then dealing with the while loop.
